<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As a dedicated professional, I am always eager to learn new methods and embrace the opportunity to implement new skills in my work. I have experience in data analysis and process optimization, having worked as a Data Annotator and Taxonomy Analyst at Pixyle.ai, and as a Specialist in Process Optimization and Automation at ProCredit Bank. With training in Python, data science, and Microsoft Power Platform (PL-7001, PL-7002, PL-7003), I’ve developed strong skills in building low-code solutions, automation, and effective communication.</p>
